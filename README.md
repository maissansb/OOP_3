Calculates the distance of two locations (cities) using latitude and longtitude coordinates.

The location of a city on the map is determined by its latitude  (in the rang -90 to 90 degrees) and
longitude  (in the rang -180 to 180 degrees), use a negative value if the location is in the west/south.
For example, Sharjah's latitude is 25º 20' 45" and longitude is 55º 23' 45". Read as 25 degrees 20
minutes 45 seconds and 55 degrees 23 minutes 45 seconds.
Let s,  s be the geographical location of a base "standpoint" and f, f be the geographical location of
a destination "forepoint", respectively. Let  = f -  s be the longitude difference and  be the
angular difference, which can be calculated using the haversin formula
(Look up haversign formula)
